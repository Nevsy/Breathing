# Breathing
This is a mindfulness website I made using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). It isn't very complex, it only has 1 primary feature, yet I hope it's still good-looking and maybe useful.

#### Features:
- a simple start - stop button which initializes the breathing exercise. 
- Visually, breathing in is visualized by a growing ball. The opposite for breathing out.
- 3 seconds of breathing in - 3 seconds of holding the breath - 3 seconds of breathing out - repeat
